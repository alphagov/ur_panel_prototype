		<h1 class="heading-xlarge">What's involved in GOV.UK user research?</h1>

		<p>There are a few ways you might be asked to help:</p>

		<h3 class="heading-medium">Face-to-face sessions</h3>

		<p>Face-to-face sessions take place at our user research lab in central London. These sessions usually last under an hour. You’ll have the chance to try new services and talk to our researchers about how you’ve used government services in the past.</p>


		<h3 class="heading-medium">Online sessions</h3>

		<p>During online sessions, you’ll be given a task to complete on GOV.UK. You don’t need to travel anywhere for these sessions but you’ll need your own computer, phone or tablet to participate. These sessions usually last 30 minutes.</p>


		<h3 class="heading-medium">Interviews</h3>	

		<p>If you take part in an interview, our user researchers will visit you at home or work to ask you questions about how you use GOV.UK. These interviews usually last under 2 hours.</p>

		<p><a href="https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/">Read the user research blog to find out more about how we carry out our research</a></p>

		<p>With your permission, we’ll record each research session. Recording allow us to share what we’ve learned and review our session at a later time. We’ll always ask your permission, and you can always say no.</p>


		<h2 class="heading-large">Eligibility</h2>	

		<p>You need to be over 16 to take part.</p>

		<p>You don’t need to be based in the UK, and you don’t have to be a UK citizen to apply. Some of the services we’ll ask you to try are created specifically for non-UK citizens.</p>

		<p>We welcome research participants who are less experienced with computers, need help using computers, or use assistive devices.</p>


		<h2 class="heading-large">What you'll get</h2>	

		<p>You’ll play a vital role in helping us improve GOV.UK.</p>

		<p>In some research instances, we provide remuneration for your time and effort. Each research invitation will include detail about remuneration for that research session.</p>


		<h2 class="heading-large">How to apply</h2>	

		<p>To make sure we only send you research invitations that are relevant to you, we need to ask you some questions about your family and current living situation.</p>

		<p>All questions are optional and we won’t share your information with anyone else.</p>

		<p><a href="apply-2/age">Apply by filling in the questionnaire</a> - it will take around 15 minutes.</p>
