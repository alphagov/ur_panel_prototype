			<p>To make government services better, we watch people use them. If you’re able to help us, we would like to watch you testing parts of GOV.UK and other government services.</p>

			<p>You don’t need to be good with computers or even use the internet very often. We’re also looking for people who need help to use the internet.</p>

			<p>When you signup, we’ll ask you some questions about you and how you use computers. We’ll add you to our research community and may ask you to test our site in the future.</p>

			<p>You must be 18 or older to take part.</p>

			{# <p>We’ll contact you no more than once a month to ask you to take part in research and your participation is always voluntary.</p> #}
